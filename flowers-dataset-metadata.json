Consider deploying that to a mobile app for outdoor enthusiasts or florist hobbyists.\n\n# Using this Dataset\n\nUse the \u0060fork\u0060 button to copy this dataset to your own Roboflow account and export it with new preprocessing settings (perhaps resized for your model\u0027s desired format or converted to grayscale), or additional augmentations to make your model generalize better. This particular dataset would be very well suited for Roboflow\u0027s new advanced [Bounding Box Only Augmentations](https://blog.roboflow.ai/introducing-bounding-box-level-augmentations/). \n\n# About Roboflow\n\n[Roboflow](https://roboflow.ai) makes managing, preprocessing, augmenting, and versioning datasets for computer vision seamless.\n\nDevelopers reduce 50% of their code when using Roboflow\u0027s workflow, automate annotation quality assurance, save training time, and increase model reproducibility.\n\n#### [![Roboflow Workmark](https://i.imgur.com/WHFqYSJ.png =350x)](https://roboflow.ai)\n\n#An illustration\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F15584165%2Fe2fe2defe3dabddb6c06894de4c1f90b%2F107592979_aaa9cdfe78_m_jpg.rf.604bc36d11e4db74c400295add2ec32f.jpg?generation=1701318250112449\u0026alt=media)\n\n\n#Utilisation Examples\nCreate a model for a flower classifier!
